  <h3> Description </h3>
  <p> What makes these snickerdoodles so good? They're thick and substantial, but with an inside that is anything but dry. A lot of snickerdoodles turn out crispy or cakey, but these have my ideal cookie center: chewy with a bit of denseness to it that makes the bite oh so satisfying. Ready to make a batch of these warm and cozy cookies? Lets get started! </p>
  <h3> Ingredients </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> 3 c. (360 g.) all-purpose flour </li>
    <li> 2 tsp. cream of tartar </li>
    <li> 1 tsp. kosher salt </li>
    <li> 3/4 tsp. baking soda </li>
    <li> 1 c. (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature </li>
    <li> 1 1/2 c. (300 g.) granulated sugar </li>
    <li> 2 large eggs </li>
    <li> 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract </li>
    <li> 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract </li>
  </ul>
  <h3> Steps </h3>
  <ol>
    <li> In a medium bowl, whisk flour, cream of tartar, salt, and baking soda until combined. In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter and 1 1/4 cups sugar until creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating to blend after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Add dry ingredients and beat on low speed until just combined. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour or up to overnight. </li>
    <li> Preheat oven to 350Â°. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. In a small bowl, whisk cinnamon and remaining 1/4 cup sugar. </li>
    <li> Using a medium cookie scoop (about 2 tablespoons), scoop dough and roll into balls. Toss balls in cinnamon sugar and arrange on prepared sheets, spacing 2" apart. </li>
    <li> Bake cookies until puffed and edges are just set, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. </li>
